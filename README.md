### mini description :

This Portfolio meant to be different. Without a template or referring to other people styles. If it's not perfect, or beautiful enough, I assure you, it was a lot of fun building it.

React, vite, React-icons, Context api, useContext, useState,useEffect, vanilla css, grid, flexbox, some music and a lot of coffee!
